README for Enemies of Carlotta, a mailing list manager
by Lars Wirzenius, liw@iki.fi


Enemies of Carlotta is a simple mailing list manager that mimicks the
ezmlm (http://www.ezmlm.org/) commands. Please see the manual page
or the home page (http://liw.iki.fi/liw/eoc/) for documentation, and
join the mailing list (send mail to eoc-subscribe@liw.iki.fi).

You need Python 2.3 or newer, and lockfile (from procmail). If you are
willing to live without having headers encoded with MIME, Python 2.1 or
2.2 should also work.

To install, edit Makefile, the variables bindir and man1dir, and
then run "make install" as root.
