Entropy of Carlotta is a simple manager for email lists.
It resembles ezmlm (http://www.ezmlm.org).

It was forked from Enemies of Carlotta (http://liw.iki.fi/eoc/)
by Lars Wirzenius, liw@iki.fi, because that package was orphaned.
But it is probably not stable yet.

It requires at least Python 2.3.
